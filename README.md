# Providence Productivity Tracker
Created in 2018 by Dinh Nguyen while working at Providence.

This is a simple offline web-based interface to help the Pre-registration team at Providence Hospital keep track of their productivity during the day.

It includes all the activity codes associated with specific tasks, each with its own time value reflecting the amount of time it should take to complete a task.

There is a total productivity time display on the right to help track progress.

In addition, there is also a search bar that helps look up department phone numbers quickly for caregivers to use as a convenience.
